PYL10N
------

Pyl10n is a localization (l10n) library for python, written in 2008-2010.

BEWARE: This is old code, migrated to git. Previously, this was found at:
https://code.osso.nl/projects/pyl10n


SUMMARY
-------

Pyl10n intends to replace the standard locale module which is not thread
safe (locale.setlocale() updates the entire process' locale settings).
Pyl10n allows you to supply the language setting at conversion function
call time or through a callback function that allows you to have a
thread-specific language. E.g.  for Django you could pass
``django.utils.translation.get_language`` which gets the currently
selected language.

Its a complement to `gettext` solutions that do not depend on
process-wide language settings.


PORTABILITY
-----------

Pyl10n has been tested with python 2.5 through 2.7 on Debian/Ubuntu
Linux systems.


EXAMPLE
-------

Import pyl10n as locale:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import pyl10n as locale

Hardcode the current thread locale.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> locale.setlocale('nl_NL')
    >>> print(locale.currency(12345.67))
    â‚¬ 12345,67

Usually you'll want to set a function that returns the current thread
locale.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> getlocale = lambda: 'en_US'
    >>> locale.setlocalefunc(getlocale)
    >>> print(locale.format('%f', 12345.67, True, True))
    12,345.67


LIMITATIONS
-----------

As of this writing, it is not complete yet. It does implement
``format()`` and ``currency()`` correctly (see
http://bugs.python.org/issue1222 ) and it has most of the time
formatting support that ``strftime(3)`` specifies.

In the near future (ha ha) it will support address formatting functions.

Look at the lists of finished and unfinished functions in the source.
